Insights:

Netflix dashboard provides valuable insights into the movies and TV shows available on the platform. Through the use of charts and maps, it becomes easy to understand the distribution of content across different countries and genres.

By analyzing the map chart, it is evident that the United States has the highest number of streaming programs compared to other countries. This could be attributed to more favorable licensing agreements that Netflix has secured in the US, allowing for a wider variety of content to be offered.

The stacked bar chart offers insights into the top 10 genres, with documentaries, stand-up comedy, and international movies occupying the top three positions. This could be due to the unique and thought-provoking perspectives that these genres offer, making them appealing to a wide range of viewers.

The pie chart shows that movies make up approximately 68% of the content on Netflix, while TV shows make up 32%. This suggests that viewers prefer watching movies over TV shows, which could be due to the shorter lead times required to produce movies compared to TV shows.

The column bar chart shows that 2027 shows or movies are rated as TV-MA, which suggests that there is content specifically created for an adult audience, not intended for children or young teens.

Finally, the area chart provides insights into the total number of movies and TV shows added each year, with the highest number being added in 2019. This could be due to Netflix's analysis of user data, which showed a high demand for certain titles, leading them to prioritize acquiring those titles.

Overall, the Netflix dashboard provides valuable insights into the content available on the platform, making it easier for viewers to make informed decisions on what to watch.
